Greedy Strategy
===============
 1 Simple Heuristic :
    The heuristic value for a cell on board is the sum of expected value of the empty cell + the possible loss of opponent's neighbor cells when it is raid.
    The algorithm greedily tries to maximize the overall gain.
    It moves on to the cell with highest heuristic value
